## Challenges

### Calling API for images from TMDB
Because of the way TMDB had destructured how images are pulled from their API, I found it not straightforward and a bit tricky at first. Thankfully, their documentation is ðŸ”¥; after a quick read, I was able to figure it out.

### Pagination
Figuring out the pagination was a bit tricky because I had to think about logic of how the pages will be displayed.

## Design Choices
Pretty much followed what screenshot I received from the Google Doc. The only thing that I made a change to is how the stars are displayed. Instead of showing ten stars and filling the stars according to the movie's rating, I copied the way IMDB displayed their star rating. The result was simplier to code and displays the same information.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
